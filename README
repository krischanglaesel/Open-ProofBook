Open ProofBook

Released under the New BSD License

OpenProofBook is an easy way for professional photographers to host their 
pictures online for their clients to review, comment on, ask for touch ups, 
and order, all designed specifically for online proofing. Unlike other 
projects (Gallery2/3, Coppermine, etc) OpenProofBook is designed specifically 
for proofing. It comes with certain protections against stealing photos from 
the proofing site, only gives users access to their own photos, and makes the 
whole process streamlined.


Django:
